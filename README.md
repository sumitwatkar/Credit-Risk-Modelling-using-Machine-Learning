# Credit Risk Modelling using Machine Learning

## Overview:

- The project focused on developing a reliable credit risk modeling system using advanced machine learning techniques to optimize the bank's lending strategy. The primary goals is to identify patterns that indicate if a person is unlikely to repay a loan (i.e., labeled as a bad risk) and to implement machine learning algorithms to build predictive models for loan risk assessment.

## Methodologies:

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Examined the dataset and performed data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering for model input.

**2. Model Development**: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and XGBoost Classifier.

**3. Model Evaluation**: Used evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score to assess model performance.

**4. Model Optimization**: Tuned hyperparameters for each model to improve performance and generalization.

**5. Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified the top features impacting loan risk, such as the total principal received, last payment amount, and total payment.

## Tools and Technologies Used:

**1. Packages**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn.

**2. Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost.

## Outcomes:

**1. Best Model Selection**: Concluded that the XGBoost Classifier was the best model for predicting loan risk due to its high ROC-AUC score compared to other models.

**2. Key Insights**: Discovered that the top factors contributing to loan risk were the total principal received, last payment amount, and total payment.

**3. Actionable Recommendations**: Suggested actions such as rejecting loans, reducing loan amounts, or lending at higher interest rates based on risk assessment.

**4. Impact**: The project optimized the bank's lending strategy by providing a robust system for automatic loan application evaluation, thereby reducing potential losses and improving decision-making.
